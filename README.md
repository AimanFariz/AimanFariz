Hi there 👋
I'm Aiman, a developer and sports analyst passionate about combining technology and sports to create innovative solutions. I'm currently a sophomore at the University of Tulsa, where I have hands-on experience in sports analytics, collaborating with the TU Men's Soccer team and analyzing data from NCAA and professional sports leagues to extract meaningful insights and build visualization tools. My GitHub features a range of projects, from web applications to sports analysis tools, reflecting my dedication to learning, creativity, and attention to detail.
